      <p>This course gives a broad overview of existing machine learning methods. We will emphasize the practical aspects of machine learning and data mining. The computational techniques we will learn in this course are broadly applicable and are behind significant advances in many fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, medicine, and several more. In addition, once we understand the basics of machine learning technology, and the close connection between theory and practice, we can help advance the frontiers of machine learning and build autonomous applications that bring value to society. </p>

      <p>All lives have intelligence, but human intelligence is special. This form of intelligence allows us to have reasoning, problem-solving, and learning skills that are arguably better than those of other species. The question is, can we build artificially intelligent agents that are similar to human's cognitive and problem-solving abilities? In this course, we will make an effort to first understand what artificial intelligence means, and study various attempts to build intelligent agents over the past several decades. Besides the quest for building human-like intelligent agents, these AI concepts/algorithms can help us build autonomous applications that bring value to society.</p>
