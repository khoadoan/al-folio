# Research Interests

Our research focuses on understanding the practical limits of using existing ML methods in the real-world. Essential, we seek answers to the following question: *How to make ML models simpler & reliable to use in constrained settings*? **Simplicity** refers to the ability to (i) build or implement the method easily, (ii) execute the deployed model efficiently, and (iii) evolve the deployed model with less effort. **Reliability** relates to (i) whether we can rely on the model to solve the intended task well, (ii) whether this performance is preserved under frequently perturbed environments in practice such as data corruptions or distributional changes, and (iii) whether the model is resilient to (i.e., its performance is not significantly affected by) various forms of security attacks such as adversarial examples and causal attacks. In this sense, we believe that many existing ML methods, including those with *complex* deep neural networks, are *reliable* but *not yet easy-to-use* because they do not satisfy various constraints seen in real-world applications. We also strongly believe the effort to answer this question will help us truly realize the potential of AI/ML methodology in practice.  

Our goal, therefore, is to develop computational frameworks that enable existing complex/deep models to be more suitable for practical uses. We focus on improving the following aspects of existing models: (i) **training/inference**, (ii) **realistic assumptions**, (iii) **algorithmic robustness**, and (iv) **efficiency in constrained settings**. Most of our ML/AI solutions center around generative-based approaches that have low computational complexity and require less human effort. Currently, our research activities include, but not limited to, the following themes (*with selected publications*):
