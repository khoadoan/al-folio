<!-- Here at **MAIL**, We develop computational frameworks that enable existing complex/deep models to be more suitable for practical uses. We focus on improving the following aspects of existing models: (i) training/inference, (ii) realistic assumptions, (iii) algorithmic robustness, and (iv) efficiency in constrained settings. Most of our ML/AI solutions center around large-scale approaches that have low computational complexity and require less human effort.
